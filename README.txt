getversion is a command-line utility to print file version information. 

It prints all the available version data it can find: .NET assembly version,
file version, file version string, product version, and product version
string, as well as product name and comments.

Simply pass it the name of the file to check.

getversion requires the .NET Framework Version 2.0.
